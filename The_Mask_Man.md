## The Box

*What happened to me?* I was tied in a bed barely awake.. Am I in hospital? The place not looks like so.. I can sense someone standing close to me and busy in watching different monitors... Is he a doctor? He looks strange! His face is covered with a mask not the surgeon mask, it's kind of different. What's he gonna do to me? He turned and advanced slowly to me.. What's in his hand? Ohh.. god no!! I jerked from my bed with all sweat... sigh!! another nightare! Never had like this one before. It seemed so real! I couldn't able to sleep further on that night.

My name is Victor, 36 years old male and I work in CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation). I live with my daughter in an apartment. I have been thinking a while to resign from this field and move to my home-town where my parents still live. May be I need to talk to my senior today?

This morning not seems to be so great... may be the dream? I prepared my daughter to the school and reached to my work place around 10. I was sitting in a chair composing my resignation in my mind... suddenly interrupted by a call. "Mr. Victor senior calls you and it's urgent!". I used to this... what's this time? extortion? murder? rape? let's see... I hurried to my senior's office.

Raghav's face looks serious and concerned. 

"We got a box!" 

"What box?" 

"A box with flesh and we suspect it's human."

"Inspector Martin will explain you further on this and I want you to drive this!"

Great! I was thinking to talk about my resignation with this guy and he assigns another case.

"Well, will do"

Martin who was standing in the room turned to me and explained. 

"The box was found in the outer city by a garbage man. We initially thought it's a cow or some animal meat. We sent it to the lab and it looks like of human."

"Male or female?"

"Female"

Yeah.. probably a rape! This city is sick!

"Do you able to identify the person?"

"Nope. It's butchered heavily... like in a machine"

"Hmm..."

"What you think the motive could be?"

"No clue.."

I and Martin walked out of the room.

"Can you look into the missing person details and see you can get something?"

"Sure Sir"

I came back to my room. Why the killer butchered the body? He don't want to identify them? No much progress has been made for the following two days. But.. in the third day we could able to match with a missing young woman (?). It was very difficult for us to convey the * with her parents. We queried her parents about her close friends, colleagues... For days I and Martin spend time investigating the case around her friends and colleagues. Nothing turned up! Even we investigated in the angle of a random person may be a cab driver... but no luck! I was about to give up.. may be move this case to someone. More than a month passed and no progress in the case yet! My senior and others started to focus on other cases. 


## The Mask Man


I'm about to start to my office. I'm gonna tell to my senior today. I'm done with this job. My mobile started ringing. It's Martin.

"Sir, we got another box"

"What..."

"Same like last time... human remains"

"Do you able to identify the gender"

"Female again"

"No doubt.. a new rapist on town."

"Donno.. What kind of person will do to this to a body?"

"Identified?"

"Yes. We started investigating her friends and colleagues"

"Hmm..."

"Oh.. almost forgot to say something"

"The guy who found the box said he saw a man driving a car"

"Did he saw the face"

"No.. he has a mask in his face"

"Mask?"

"Yeah.. pollution mask?"

"In car?"

"Yeah"


## The Third Box


Days and weeks passed. Lot of people and lot of investigations. No progress. This case started to become a headache. At now, me, my senior and Martin all in the assumption it's more a rape. Both the woman are raped by a same person or same people. Both of them are young and good looking and there is no connection between them. This case is really testing my gut. I used to have a good name around this department in solving cases short time. This one not seems to be so! There is no much news about this mask man. Maybe he was just driving to city.

I'm still wondering how I can convey resignation to my senior. Exactly after a month... there is another box! This time it not belonged to a woman but to a young man. This is no more work of a rapist. I can sense all the victims have some mysterious connections. All are young and fit. Even more surprisingly all of them had same blood group. The killer definitely has a motive but can't figure out it yet.

It's a sunday and I'm sitting in my home thinking about the box, victims, the mask man... my daughter is watching some holywood movie looks like it's Arnold's Predator. Suddenly she turned to me and asked a question.

"Why this predator kills human?"

"May be for the skull? Looks like they love our skulls"

My thoughts again started to roam around the case. Suddenly it strike me. May be the killer is looking for something? Is he taking some body parts from the victims. I called Martin in phone.

"Hello Sir"

"Is any body parts are missing in the victims?"

"It's hard to know. They are heavily ... We thought in that angle too but we didn't find anything seriously missing"

"Maybe we've to look hard enough"

I quit the call. I can sense something turning up in my mind. He is looking for specific people. Who are healthy, fit and happy. May be all of them fits to his profile in someway. But how could he know that? How we can know the blood group of all of them? Unless he is working in some hospital... yes!! I again called Martin.

"Martin, can you check the victims recently visited any hospital?"

"Yes boss. Will do"

"I want it quick. Let's meet at office."

I'm hoping something will turn this time. I hugged my daughter and hurried to office.


## The Motive


How hard the life was, it's a difficult thing from the day I wake up to turn to bed the medications I need to take, the drops I need to use... but that was past everything changed now. The doctors said some kind of an auto immune condition. Fools, they have no clue about human body. The Mask Man stares at the calendar and this day is special for him, the day he discovered the cure. He was born to wealthy parents. He remembers how his father was with him always giving hope. One day this will cure. The thoughts of his past started to pour inside his mind. It all started like some asthma when he was just 12 and soon started to get worse. He started to pains all over joints and all over the body. He remembers his father taking him dozens of hospitals but nothing changed. There were frequent between his mom and dad and one day his mom took posion and left both of them alone. His father started to drink everyday and died in an accident and after that his grandma started to take care of him.

The school life was tough for him. There were no friends and he was always alone. Everyone looked him odd seeing him always wearing a mask. Maybe he is sick, they thought. The loneliness didn't affect him. In fact, he has problems to connect with people too. Though nature gave him a weak body but blessed him with a highly intellectual brain. His teachers surprised by this intelligent and the same time concerned by his behavior. The behavior he can't even see the fellow human beings as his own level. For him they are immatured and low lives. This thought started to grow more and more along with the disease. After this father's deadth he swore to find a cure for his disease. He read every popular book out there. He didn't even miss to know the classic medicine. But nothing worked. He started to consult lot of doctors to know about this disease better but only very disappointed by their stupid science. The science where they see the human body is made of independent parts manufactured by different companies. Everything changed in this day. When his more evolved brain cracked the puzzle - the genetic code. He hurried to his usual doctor and asked about the new things he discovered in genetics.

"Doctor if someone with this genetic profile can donate their bone marrow.. I think.. it'll resolve my immune condition"

"Comeon! Google is not a doctor. I don't think there is a cure for this condition. You should better continue the immuno suppresants"

"But Doc.. I think..."

"Who is the doctor here? I'm the one. Don't teach me about medicine"

"But doc... treating symptons not gonna help. I spent a lot of money on this. I WANT THE CURE"

"Don't shout at me. I don't have time for this. There are patients waiting out there. Better you get out from here"

There is no cure. This is what this fool say. But I know there is a cure. I need to test it. Why not I can this foolish doctor for my experiment. On that night I kidnapped the doc and for the first I did a surgery. His genetic profile was different but atleast I know how to do it. Now it's a matter of time to do it on the right one.

He was thinking about the two young woman and the man... how easily he trapped them. How foolish these human beings are? All these social sites and the internet things gives ton of information about a person, their interests, their movements.. and more. It's a month over now from the last. The bottles are already running out. He has to fill the new bottles today. Luckily he already have a prey. This time it's a woman. Let's do it! He hurries to the basement where the poor woman is tied in a bed.


## The Lab


How he could get the acces to their blood? Is he working in hospital? Martin didn't call me yet! Atone my phone rang.

"Boss. You don't believe this"

"All of them visited hospital in a month period"

"Yes... Yes. Same hospital?"

"No"

"No?"

"Two of them visited the City hospital and the other one different"

"Alright. Thanks"

So it's not the same hospital! That's little discouraging but let's take a visit to the City hospital.

"Two months back, these people visited your hospital. May I know what tests they've gone?"

"They came for usual health checkup"

"What kind of tests you people taken?"

"Usual"

"All the tests are done here?"

"Yes. No... except the serology test. That we send to a lab"

Lab?

"Can you share the details of the lab?"

"Yes, sure."

My phone started to ring. It's Martin.

"Boss. I talked with the doctor. That person came for health checkup"

"Did you ask what tests they have taken"

"Yes. And one more thing. For some tests they send the samples to a lab"

"Thanks a ton! That's all I want to know"

I started my car engine and hurried to the lab that is in the west corner of the city.
