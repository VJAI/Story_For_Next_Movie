## The Box

*What happened to me?* I was tied in a bed barely awake.. Am I in hospital? The place not looks like so.. I can sense someone standing close to me and busy in watching different monitors... Is he a doctor? He looks strange! His face is covered with a mask not the surgeon mask, it's kind of different. What's he gonna do to me? He turned and advanced slowly to me.. What's in his hand? Ohh.. god no!! I jerked from my bed with all sweat... sigh!! another nightare! Never had like this one before. It seemed so real! I couldn't able to sleep further on that night.

My name is Victor, 36 years old male and I work in CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation). I live with my daughter in an apartment. I have been thinking a while to resign from this field and move to my home-town where my parents still live. May be I need to talk to my senior today?

This morning not seems to be so great... may be the dream? I prepared my daughter to the school and reached to my work place around 10. I was sitting in a chair composing my resignation in my mind... suddenly interrupted by a call. "Mr. Victor senior calls you and it's urgent!". I used to this... what's this time? extortion? murder? rape? let's see... I hurried to my senior's office.

Raghav's face looks serious and concerned. 

"We got a box!" 

"What box?" 

"A box with flesh and we suspect it's human."

"Inspector Martin will explain you further on this and I want you to drive this!"

Great! I was thinking to talk about my resignation with this guy and he assigns another case.

"Well, will do"

Martin who was standing in the room turned to me and explained. 

"The box was found in the outer city by a garbage man. We initially thought it's a cow or some animal meat. We sent it to the lab and it looks like of human."

"Male or female?"

"Female"

Yeah.. probably a rape! This city is sick!

"Do you able to identify the person?"

"Nope. It's butchered heavily... like in a machine"

"Hmm..."

"What you think the motive could be?"

"No clue.."

I and Martin walked out of the room.

"Can you look into the missing person details and see you can get something?"

"Sure Sir"

I came back to my room. Why the killer butchered the body? He don't want to identify them? No much progress has been made for the following two days. But.. in the third day we could able to match with a missing young woman (?). It was very difficult for us to convey the * with her parents. We queried her parents about her close friends, colleagues... For days I and Martin spend time investigating the case around her friends and colleagues. Nothing turned up! Even we investigated in the angle of a random person may be a cab driver... but no luck! I was about to give up.. may be move this case to someone. More than a month passed and no progress in the case yet! My senior and others started to focus on other cases. 


## The Mask Man


I'm about to start to my office. I'm gonna tell to my senior today. I'm done with this job. My mobile started ringing. It's Martin.

"Sir, we got another box"

"What..."

"Same like last time... human remains"

"Do you able to identify the gender"

"Female again"

"No doubt.. a new rapist on town."

"Donno.. What kind of person will do to this to a body?"

"Identified?"

"Yes. We started investigating her friends and colleagues"

"Hmm..."

"Oh.. almost forgot to say something"

"The guy who found the box said he saw a man driving a car"

"Did he saw the face"

"No.. he has a mask in his face"

"Mask?"

"Yeah.. pollution mask?"

"In car?"

"Yeah"


## The Third Box


Days and weeks passed. Lot of people and lot of investigations. No progress. This case started to become a headache. At now, me, my senior and Martin all in the assumption it's more a rape. Both the woman are raped by a same person or same people. Both of them are young and good looking and there is no connection between them. This case is really testing my gut. I used to have a good name around this department in solving cases short time. This one not seems to be so! There is no much news about this mask man. Maybe he was just driving to city.

I'm still wondering how I can convey resignation to my senior. Exactly after a month... there is another box! This time it not belonged to a woman but to a young man.
