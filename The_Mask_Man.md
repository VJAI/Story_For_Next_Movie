> The world needs cure and I've one! - *The Mask Man*

## The Box

What happened to me? I was tied in a bed barely awake.. Am I in hospital? The place not looks like so.. I can sense someone standing close to me. His face is covered with an odd mask.  Is he a doctor? What's he gonna do to me? He turned and advanced slowly.. What's in his hand? Oh.. god no... stop it! I jerked from my bed with all sweat. Sigh!! another nightare! It seemed so real!

My name is Victor, 36 years old male and I work with CBI. I live with my daughter in an apartment. I have been thinking for a while to resign this job and move to my hometown where my parents still live. I should talk to my boss today.

This morning not seems to be so great. May be the dream? I dropped my daughter at school and reached office around 10. I was sitting in a chair composing my resignation in my mind... suddenly interrupted by a call. "Victor, boss calls you and it's urgent!". I used to this before, what's this time? extortion? murder? rape? let's see... I rushed to my boss room.

Darwin's face looks serious and concerned. 

"We got a box!" 

"Box? What box?" 

"A box with flesh and we suspect it's human"

"Inspector Martin will explain you further and I want you to get on this quick"

Great! I was thinking to talk about my resignation today and here I get another case.

"Well.. alright"

Martin who was standing in the room turned to me. 

"The box was found in the outer city by a garbage collector. We initially thought it's a cow or some animal meat. We sent it to the lab and they confirmed it's of human."

"Male or female?"

"Female"

"Did you identify the person?"

"No, not yet. It's butchered heavily"

"Hmm..."

"What you think the motive could be?"

"No clue"

I and Martin walked out of the room.

"Can you look into the missing person details and see you can get something?"

"Sure"

Probably a rape. This city is sick. Why the killer butchered the body? He don't want to identify them?

No much progress has been made for the following two days. In the third day we could able to match with a missing young woman. It was very difficult for us to convey to her parents. We asked her parents about her close friends and colleagues. For days I and Martin spend time investigating the case around her friends and colleagues. Nothing turned up. More than a month passed and no movement in the case yet.


## The Mask Man


I'm about to start to my office. I'm gonna tell to my boss today. I'm done with this job. My mobile started ringing. It's Martin.

"Sir, we got another box"

"What?"

"Same like last time... it's a female"

"No doubt.. a new rapist on town."

"Donno.. What kind of person will do to this to a body?"

"Identified?"

"Yes. We started investigating her friends and colleagues"

"Hmm..."

"Oh.. almost forgot to say something"

"The guy who found the box said he saw a man driving a car"

"Did he see the face?"

"No. He had a mask"

"Mask?"

"Yeah.. pollution mask?"

"In car?"

"Yeah"


## The Third Box


Days and weeks passed. Lot of people and lot of investigations. No progress. This case turned into a headache. At now, me, my boss and Martin all in the assumption it's more a rape. Both the woman are raped by a same person or same people. Both of them are young and good looking and there is no connection between them. There is no much news about this mask man. Maybe he was just driving to city.

I'm still wondering how I can convey resignation to my senior. Exactly after a month there is another box! This time it not belonged to a woman but to a young man. This is no more work of a rapist. I can sense all the victims have some mysterious connections. All are young and fit. Even more surprisingly all of them had same blood group. The killer definitely has a motive but can't figure out it yet.

It's a sunday and I'm sitting in my home thinking about the box, victims, the mask man... my daughter is watching some movie looks like it's Arnold's Predator. Suddenly she turned to me and asked a question.

"Why predator kills human?"

"They are fond of skulls"

My thoughts again started to spin around the case. Suddenly it stroke me. May be the killer is looking for something? Is he taking some body parts from the victims. I called Martin.

"Hello, Sir"

"Is any body parts are missing in the victims?"

"It's hard to know. They are heavily... you know. We thought in that angle too but we didn't find anything seriously missing"

"Maybe you've to look hard enough"

I quit the call. I can feel something turning up. He is looking for specific people. Who are healthy, fit and happy. May be all of them fits to his profile in someway. But how could he know that? How he can know the blood group of all of them? Unless he is working in some hospital? Yes! I again called Martin.

"Martin, can you check the victims recently visited any hospital?"

"Yes boss. Will do"

"I want it quick. Let's meet at office."

I'm hoping something will turn this time. I hugged my daughter and hurried to office.


## The Motive


How hard life was, it was difficult and tiring from the day I woke up until I turn to bed. All those medications... all those drops... all those steroids... but that was past. Everything changed now. The doctors said some kind of an auto immune condition. Fools, they have no clue about human body. The Mask Man stares at the calendar and this day is special for him. The day he discovered the cure. He was born to wealthy parents. He remembers how his father was always saying one day this will cure. The thoughts of his past started to pour inside his mind. It all started like some asthma when he was just twelve and soon started to get worse. He started to get pains all over joints and all over the body. He remembers his father taking him to all famous hospitals but nothing changed. There were frequent fights between his mom and dad and one day his mom took posion and left both of them alone. His father started to drink everyday and died in an accident and his life changed forever.

The school life was tough for him. There were no friends and he was always alone. Everyone looked at him odd seeing him always wearing a mask. Maybe he is sick, they thought. The loneliness didn't affect him. In fact, he has trouble to connect with people too. Though nature cursed him with a weak body but blessed him with a highly intellectual brain. His teachers surprised by this smartness and the same time concerned by his behavior. The behavior he can't even see the fellow students as his own fellow human beings. I'm more than them, he thought always. For him they are immatured and low lives. This thought started to grow more and more along with the disease. After his father's deadth he was living his grandma and swore to find a cure for his disease. He read every popular book out there. He didn't even miss to know about the holistic medicine. But nothing worked. He started to consult lot of doctors to know about this disease better but only very disappointed by their stupid science. The science where they see the human body is made of independent parts manufactured by different companies. Everything changed in this day. When his more evolved brain cracked the puzzle - the genetic code. He hurried to his usual doctor and asked about the new things he discovered.

"Doctor, if someone with this genetic profile can donate their bone marrow.. I think.. it'll resolve my immune condition"

"Google is not a doctor. I don't think there is a cure for this condition. You should better continue the immuno suppresants"

"But Doc.. I think..."

"Who is the doctor here? I'm the one. Don't teach me about medicine"

"But doc... treating symptons not gonna help. I spent a lot of money on this. I WANT THE CURE!"

"Don't shout at me. I don't have time for this. There are patients waiting out there. Better you leave"

There is no cure. This is what this fool say. But I know there is a cure. I need to test it. Why not I can use this foolish rat for my experiment. On that night he kidnapped the doc and for the first time he practised surgery.

He was thinking about the two young woman and the man... how easily he trapped them. How foolish they are? All these social sites and the internet gives ton of information about a person, their interests, their movements.. and more. It's a month over now from the last hunt. The storage bottles are already running out. He has to fill the new bottles today. Luckily he already have a prey. Let's do it! He hurried to the basement where the poor woman is tied in a bed.


## The Lab


How he could get the access to their blood? Is he working in hospital? Martin didn't call me yet! My phone rang.

"Boss. You don't believe this. All of them visited hospital in a month period"

"Yesss, Same hospital?"

"No"

"No?"

"Two of them visited the City hospital and the other one different"

"Message the details. Thanks"

"Is anything else you need?"

"No"

So it's not the same hospital! That's little discouraging but let's take a visit to the City hospital.

"I'm from CBI. Two months back, these people visited your hospital. May I know for what diagnosis they came for?"

"Yes, Sure"

"They came for usual health checkup"

"What kind of tests they've gone?"

"Usual"

"All these tests are done here?"

"Yes. No... except the serology test. That we send to a lab"

Lab? Interesting...

"Can you share the details of the lab?"

"Yes, sure."

My phone started to ring. It's Martin.

"Boss. I talked with the doctor. That person came for mild fever"

"Did you ask what tests they have taken"

"Yes. And one more thing. For some tests they send the samples to a lab"

"Thanks a ton! That's all I want to know"

There is something happening in the lab. May be soe weird experiments with human? I started my car engine and hurried to the lab that is in the west corner of the city. The lab looks normal nothing seems to be strange. I didn't tell them that I'm a cop. I told I came for the usual blood check-up. A lady turned up and took me to a room where they collected the sample. I was looking into her to sense anything suspicious going on. She was friendly and nothing seems to be strange. I gave some speech to her to see whether I can get something. I was about to leave the room and I saw something in the tabe. What is that? It's a mask! I turned to her and asked.

"It's difficult nowadays to survive without masks isn't it?"

"Oh.. that one? It's not mine. It's Jade's. He left early today"

Jade?

"Oh, yeah... I remember him. We met last time when he did the test. Shit... I lost his number"

"You want his number?"

"It would be great"

I noted down the number she gave and moved out of the lab quickly. I called Martin and asked to find the location of the number immediately. He gave the details in minutes. It's half an hour from the lab. May be this is the guy we are searching? I reached his house and it's not surrounded by many houses. What an ideal place to do the surgery? I knocked at the door. A old lady showed up. I asked about Jade. Jade is the tenant and living in the top floor. I took the stairs and reached the top floor in slow steps. The door was closed. I knocked it and there was no reply. I knocked it little harder and the door opened. It's not closed. He is not inside? I started to search the house to see whether I can find anything before Jade or the old lady shows up. The room looks unclean and a usual bachelor room. There is nothing strange. I searched everywhere and frustrated. There is nothing other than the usual stuff. May be Jade is not the killer? Am I overthinking?


## The Challenge

The Mask Man started getting busy for his next surgery and he is mildly interrupted by the ping sound in his advanced mobile. His eyes widened seeing the app showing someone entering his house. Who is he? Is he a cop? Looks so. The Mask Man not a bit surprised or even shocked and he was just watching the live stream in amusement. Alright they got some clue but he knows it's never gonna lead towards him. He is totally in a different place. No one can even imagine this place. He saw Victor leaving his room and closed the app. We've to fix that lock in his rented house but the good thing is I know someone is behind me. He turned towards the woman tied in the bad barely awake and started to get busy with the surgery. Once he get what he wants she'll be just a pile of flesh in a box. Yes in a box, he thought.

Victor about to leave the the room and suddenly shocked by a delivery man standing in front of the door.

"Jade? You got a delivery"

For a second I about to say no but then,

"Yes. Thanks"

The delivery man left. I took it and came back to my office. For minutes I was staring at the small parcel sitting on my desk. May be I should leave it in the room? But finally I started to open it. Voila! What the hell are these medicines? I see different kind of medicines in the box. My face lightened up. We got something. I googled and it showed these medicines are used as anaesthesia and for other things. Wohooo... this is our guy!!! I called Martin and asked him to come to office immediately. We together again started to drive towards the old lady's house.

Jade was still not there. Luckily the old lady didn't show up this time. May be she was sleeping. We did a thorough search again. There should be some secret room. The app confirms the mobile is still here. Is Jade left the mobile here? After spending hald an hour minutes we found the mobile. It's a china made. We can't misjudge this guy.

"Sir... there is a camera here"

Martin shouted.

The Mask Man got surprised by the delivered message from Amazon. He didn't collect the parcel. Then who did? The cop? Another ping sound from his mobile showed the live stream of two people searching his room. He's not a bit surprised yet. He just watched them like a cat watching a mouse.

Victor turned to the Camera and said in low clear voice.

"I know you are watching me. I'll find you.. and.. hunt you"

Victor left the place with Jade's mobile.

The Mask Man got angry. A human hunt him? I'm the hunter and you are the hunt, he said himself. He knows from the time he was a boy he was way more smarter than the fellow children. He never considered himself same as them. He thinks always they are way lower than him. How he can challenge himself? His voice echoed in his brain making him more angry. He remembers how he hunted each of the people. It didn't take much time for him to hack the hospital systems and for every blood sample it was easy to get the person's address. All these social media and the internet they leak lot about each people. You just put a nice profile pic and send a friend request they accept it. You can easily know their interests, location and more. What more a predator wants? He remembers the trap he set for each one and how easy to hunt them. This rat vows he hunt me... nope.. i'll hunt him.

On that night, the Mask Man broke to the lab and stole all the blood samples.


## The Chase


Victor is not happy. He should have warned the lab. It's late, Jade got the samples. It may not be Jade who knows his real name. He faked everything. Where he really lives? The china modile revealed many things. It's very customizes. All the messages and calls are forwarded to some network that connects hundreds and thousands of computers and finally reaching to the original phone. He is extremely good at many things. Good at hacking. Good at faking. Good at alluring people. How we can find him? He knows now for why he hunt the people. Bone marrow. It's missing in each of the victim. He always wears a mask maybe he is allergic to something. He is sick Victor thought. He hunt people for medicine. Victor already asked Martin to search bio profile of the missing samples with the victims. May be we can watch closely the people that got matched and trap the guy? Victor was tired and slowly sneaked into sleep.

It was mid night. There was a sound outside the apartment. Victor woke up. The security was shouting. Victor jumped from the bed and reached the ground floor. He saw the security guard and bunch of people are standing and chatting.

"What's going on?"

Victor asked the security.

"I saw a man sneaking into the parking area. I shouted at him and he left."

"Did you see him"

"No. It was dark and couldn't see him clearly"

"Robbers"

The neighbhour apartment guy said. Victor got little concerned and went back to his apartment.

Weeks passed. Victor and Martin collected some information from the old lady. Unfortuntaely she has a poor eye sight. They noted whatever she said and came up with a rough photo. They asked the neighbhours and the lab employees. No body knows much about. He is a loner and a man of few words. They already got the information of the people who missed their blood samples, including him. He has to yet get the info of the potentially matching samples. He asked Martin ***

Victor and Martin are in the car. Victor started to wonder the Mask Man would be doing now. Setting the trap for the next prey. From the latest turn over of the investigation he got more info about how he kidnapped. He used the social sites as the tools to get close with them. They haven't got anything useful from his fake account and they blocked them as well.

"Martin..."

"Yes Sir"

"What he would be doing now?"

"I think he might be scared of us and hiding somewhere"

"No.. no.. I don't think so"

"If you notice.. every box we got around 40-45 days"

"Yeah"

"From the last box... Today it's the 45th day from the last box"

"Oh.. Yeah"

"He may be following someone. Did you get any information?"

"No. I haven't got any suspicious from the guards"

"Ask them to be alert"

Few metres after a car is following with a man wearking mask inside. He was following him for couple of weeks now. He was interested in the conversation they are having now. It was little risky for him on that day to sneak him into his apartment and implant that tracking device in the car. The security guy nearly caught him. He got very interested in Victor. He learnt a lot following him every day. He is impressed seeing how fit, healthy and happy he is. He never gives up. Is this quality he liked very much.

He was glancing outside the window watching the people. They are always in hurry like the sky is falling down. How small their world is. Without knowing what life is and what it's purpose they live everyday. They are living for someones dreams. The world needs a cure and I've one. Once I fix myself, I'll fix this world. God has created me for a purpose, I know it and I'll implement it.

"Victor... Is that black car following us?"

"You... may be... right. I saw that before too?"

"Do you see who is sitting there?"

"Looks like a male... what he is wearing?"

"It's our man!" Victor yelled.

The Mask Man turned the car quickly and drove fast. Victor started following him. He took quick turns and suddenly vanished. Victor stunned where he went? He may not have escaped. Victor parked the car aside. Both of them get out of the car and started to roam their eyes. This place is very strange! It's a old town that still survives in the city. Quite a number of old buildings still spending their live here. May be this is his home. Yes, there is the black car. Where is he? It's in front of a build old building. Victor and Martin took their gun out and slowly entered into the house.


## The Hunt

They reached the hall and there was two pathways. Victor took right and there is a staircase that went down. He walked down and there was a room. The door was open. He walked some steps slowly and what he found seems to be a small library with tonnes of books on all medical subjects even including old indian medicine. There are lot of diagrams throughout the wall. He has done a lot of work. Maybe he found the cure for his disease. He must be inside somewhere. Why he didn't eascape? Suddenly there is a beep sound in his phone. Shit! I should have kept it silent. Victor carefully took the phone there is an email from the doctor who is working for him. Right, he got the people names that matching the killer's profile. Victor saw the first name and his heart nearly stopped. Whattttt? Is it my name listed out first? When he got his blood? Oh... shit... yeah.. I gave the blood for test when I visited the lab. Suddenly something bit on his neck. What's that? It's.... a... needle? Victor eyes started to roll and he went unconsicuous. 

The Mask Man was surprised when he ran the bio match for the samples he stole from the lab. It's no other than the man who said will hunt him was the only match and best one ever he had. Maybe he is the cure. He'll cure me forever. Like every prey first he learns their weakness. The first victim was obsessed with fitness. Al he needed was a profile with a good pic to impress her. Each one them followingly he used their own weakness to draw them to his trap. It took quite some time to learn Victor's weaknes and he found at last. It's the attitute that chase and not gives up. He used that to chase him in the car. It's sad Victor didn't know that.

The Mask Man pulled Victor and moved to a dark room nothing but the lab. He has more work to do. He has to stop Martin. It took a lot of time to find a place like his, old and isolated. Only old people and beggers come to this building. The old building is full on camera surveillance. The Mask Man turned on the computer and he saw Martin was coming to the basement. He took a gun with silencer. Martin was shocked to see Victor lying in the ground. He panicked and turned everywhere. He was here. He took low steps and started to move towards Victor. He slowly bent down and turn Victor and... who the hell? It's late. The Mask Man pulled the trigger couple of times in the head. Martin died with eyes in shock. Good riddance. He has to now only take care of their car to vanish all the evidence.
