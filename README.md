I'm a day dreamer and I dream about a lot interesting characters and stories. In this place I record all of them. These stories are written in short and they have enough information to write a lengthy novel or create a wonderful movie. Each story has a price tag attach to it. Once the story is purchased they acquire the full rights to do anything with it. If more parties are interested in a story then it goes for bidding and the one who pays the maximum will own it.

> *All of these stories are born from my own mind and if they relates to any book or movie or real character(s) it's just by coincidence.*
